# DailyJournal

Hello! DailyJournal is a small CRUD web application that is exactly what the title entails. Users can create, read, edit, and delete posts from their own
personal daily journal. This project uses pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and EJS templating for the front-end, Express and node.js for the backend, and mySQL
as its database.

## Build

  1. run - npm i (to install node dependencies)
  2. in modules/connect.js - reconfigure db_config to connect to your local mySQL database.
  3. run - nodemon app.js
  4. project will be hosted on 'localhost:3000'. Enjoy!
